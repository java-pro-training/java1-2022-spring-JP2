            Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is 
            designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
            It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, 
            run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms 
            that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically 
            compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the 
            underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, 
            but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides 
            dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) 
            that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. 
            As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use 
            according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for clientâ€“server web applications, 
            with a reported 9 million developers.
